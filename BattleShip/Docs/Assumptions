1) The input for ship positions is in format (1,2,N) (3,3,E) (4,5,W) etc
    It is assumed that the order while updating these ships with their move sequence and shot coordinates will be entered in that order.
    for example for above example input, first the move and shotcoordinate entries will be entered for ship (1,2,N) and then (3,3,E) 
    and then (4,5,W) 
   
2) The position of the ship will remain same if
	i) it is trying to move to another ships location
	ii)it has next move sequence , which will make that ship fall off the grid
	
3) With every ship, the ship will move first and then take shot.

4) It is assumed that the initial entries for ship position can contain same coordinates i.e., 
	ship can be placed in the same location may be facing in a different direction.
	 for ex: (1,2,N) (1,2,W) is considered valid input
	 
5) Security is not considered in this implementation

6) Pure core programming language is used to create the code with no dependencies on any other libraries (except Junit)
   A DI framework and a validator framework would make it easier to develope and test.
